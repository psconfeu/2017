Enabling WinRM 
Browse to:


Policies > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Windows Remote Management (WinRM) > WinRM Service 
 Open the “Allow Remote Server management through WinRM” policy setting (Server 2008 R2 and later).






Open the “Allow automatic configuration of listeners” policy setting (Server 2008 and earlier). 
Set the Policy to Enabled.

 In addition to this, you will have to enable WinRM service to start automatically on the client machines.
 To configure the WinRM service to start automatically, navigate to Computer Configuration Policies > Windows Settings > Security Settings > System Services > Windows Remote Management,
 Doubleclick on Windows Remote Management and configure the service startup mode to “Automatic”:

When the rule is created, you may choose to make further restrictions, i.e. to only allow the IP addresses of your management subnet, or perhaps some specific user groups:
 Note that this is the minimal configuration that we have done, there is a lot more you can do with the settings, but that is something beyond the scope of this article. Feel free to explore the policy settings.
